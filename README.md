# meltdown

I initially started this project as a means to figure out which paintings by the artists Claude Monet, Piet Mondrian, Marcel Duchamp, and Ernst Kirchner were the basis for Sherrie Levine's extremely pixelated or monochromatic works titled Meltdown, which comprise a series she begins in 1989. I began working on this series as part of my PhD research, and have also worked on it as part of MoMA's Museum Research Symposium.

While I ultimately found the sources for the original set of Meltdowns through archival research, I also realized that this project can tell us a lot about how different means of quanitifying colors may actually alter how compressed images store color. 

For instance, the "meltdowns" produced by averaging RGB values tended to produce grey and blue images. 

I hope to translate this project, which was origially made using Python, into React, and to make it an online generator where users can submit images to be "melted down".
